Videogames can clearly consume the attention of children and adolescents.However, it is
important to assess the extent that videogame
technology had an impact on childhood education. Since videogames have the capacity to
engage children in learning experiences, this
has led to the rise of “edu-tainment” media. Just
by watching children it becomes very clear that
they prefer this type of approach to learning.
So we try to design and implement games that have educational characteristics and are still fun.

Research dating
right back to the early 1980s has consistently
shown that playing computer games
(irrespective of genre) produces reductions in
reaction times, improved hand-eye
co-ordination and raises players’ self-esteem.
What’s more, curiosity, fun and the nature of
the challenge also appear to add to a game’s
educational potential

Τα βιντεοπαιχνίδια είναι φανέρο οτι έχουν την δυνατότητα να 
κεντρίζουν το ενδιαφέρον των παιδιών και των εφήβων.
Σαφώς και αποτελεί ενα μέσο διασκέδασης μικρών και 
μεγάλων,ωστόσο αυτο δεν σημαίνει οτι δεν μπόρουν αποτελέσουν και ενα μέσο εκπαίδευσης,
με αξιοσημείωτα αποτελέσματα στην μαθηση. 
Στόχος μας είναι να δημιουργήσουμε παιχνίδια διασκεδαστικά και συνάμα εκπαιδευτικά.

Videogames can clearly consume the attention of children and adolescents.For sure 
videogames is one of the main entertaiment media of young people,that does not mean that 
they can not serve well as educational media with significant good results in the learning process.
Our goal is to design and implement fun and still educational games.
