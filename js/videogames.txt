Videogames can clearly consume the attention of children and adolescents.However, it is
important to assess the extent that videogame
technology had an impact on childhood education. Since videogames have the capacity to
engage children in learning experiences, this
has led to the rise of “edu-tainment” media. Just
by watching children it becomes very clear that
they prefer this type of approach to learning.
So we try to design and implement games that have educational characteristics and are still fun.

Research dating
right back to the early 1980s has consistently
shown that playing computer games
(irrespective of genre) produces reductions in
reaction times, improved hand-eye
co-ordination and raises players’ self-esteem.
What’s more, curiosity, fun and the nature of
the challenge also appear to add to a game’s
educational potential

Σαφως και αποτελει ενα μεσο διασκεδασης μικρων και μεγαλων,ωστοσο αυτο δεν τους αφερει την δυνατοτητα να εχουν και εκπεδευτικο χαρακτηρα,
με αξιοσημιοτα αποτελεσματα στην μαθηση. Στοχος μας ειναι να δημιουργησουμε παιχνιδια διασκεδαστικα και εκπεδευτικα.
